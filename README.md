# Talbott_and_fractional_Talbott_effects

#### About
This repository includes code for a MATLAB demonstration of Talbott effect (or self-imaging) and fractional Talbott effect (or contrast reversal). 
An amplitude grating with a given transmission function t(x, y) = 0.5[1 + cos(2 \pi f_0 x)] is considered and its diffraction pattern is computed at first and second Talbott distances. 
The program also demostrates fractional Talbott effect (contrast reversal).

#### Running the program:
The program may be executed by running the 'main.m' script file.

#### Results:
The 'images' folder contains image file with the simulation results.
